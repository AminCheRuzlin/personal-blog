🚀 How to Run This Project

To view and interact with this project locally:

### 1. **Set Up a Local Server (for JSP support)**

Since `login.jsp` is used, you need a Java Server (like Apache Tomcat) to run JSP files.

#### Steps:
1. Install [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) (recommended version: 9 or later).
2. Copy the entire project folder into the `webapps` directory of Tomcat.
3. Start the Tomcat server.
4. Open a browser and go to:

http://localhost:8080/your-folder-name/index.html


### 2. **If You're Only Testing the Frontend (No Server Needed)**

If you're not using JSP and just want to preview the HTML and CSS:

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with browser).
2. Note: The login link (`login.jsp`) will not work without a server.

## 🧩 Features
